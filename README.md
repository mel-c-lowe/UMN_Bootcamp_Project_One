# TITLE: MMR Immunization Trends

# Questions we want to ask:
Did the proportion of students vaccinated during the 2017 to 2018 school year change during the 2018 to 2019 school year?
Is there a difference in the proportion of students vaccinated by state?
Are public schools more likely to have a higher proportion of vaccinated children than charter or private institutions?
Does the proportion of school-aged children vaccinated vary by city or town population?
